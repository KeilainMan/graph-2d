**Graph 2D is an addon able to display curves in your user interface in a very simple way**.

This repository contains the add-on and examples.

## Features

- Plot several curves on the same graph.
- Supports curve thickness and color.
- Customizable chart axes (axis label and grid).
- Real-time plotting.
- Works with both the GLES3 and GLES2 renderers.
- Works on desktop platforms and HTML5 (others target were not tested).

## Usage

### Simple plot
- Create a new scene with a *Control* type as root node.
    - Attach a script to your root node.
- Add a *Graph2D* node as a child of the root node.
- To create a new curve, call the method `Graph2D.add_curve()` from your script. The arguments are in order the name of the curve, its color and finally the thickness of the line.
    - Note: This method will return an identifier (integer) which will then be used to reference the curve and update its points.
- There are two ways to draw a curve:
    - To draw a curve point by point (real-time), you must use the method `Graph2D.add_point()`. The arguments are in order the curve identifier and the coordinates of the point (Vector2)
    - To draw a curve from a set of points, use the method `Graph2D.add_points()`. The arguments are in order the curve identifier and a  list of points of type `PoolVector2Array`.
